                    <p class="text-justify"><span class="und-line">Biography</span>: 
                    I've been a member of EOC since 2000. After
                    taking my first class I was hooked! This was not surprising since my
                    love affair with dogs started at an early age. These kind of training
                    opportunities were not available to me growing up, so I love to
                    encourage people to take advantage of everything that's available today
                    for them and their dogs.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify"><span class="und-line">Training Philosophy</span>:
                    The purpose of the Puppy Class is to
                    introduce the handler (you) to training your puppy. And to introduce
                    the puppy to learning. My goal is to make it fun for everyone. This
                    class is purely positive reinforcement. The idea is to create an
                    environment where the puppies can be successful. We address basic
                    behavioral issues privately before and after class sessions, but class
                    time is for learning and fun!</p>

During high school and college poodles were still part of my life, but not competitive training.  I got back to training in the 90's when I started working with Rosie Baldwin.  In order to start to compete, I found the Evansville Obedience Club.  I am a CGC and STAR Puppy Evaluator.  I am a past member of the Agility Club of Evansville.  As an active member of the Evansville Kennel Club, I am Vice President, Seminar Chairperson, and Hospitality Chairperson for one of the largest dog shows held in the nation.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify"><span class="und-line">Biography</span>: During the 1970s I participated in a kid's summer training program with my Miniature Poodle in Wisconsin where I grew-up. We won obedience and tricks competition and I was hooked. My dad then bought me my first "show dog". A Standard Schnauzer that was fabulous. She was nationally ranked but more importantly taught me many things about life and training. Since then I have always had a dog that I was training/showing.  I have had many, many breeds throughout my life. I love the diversity in dogs and enjoy the challenge of training a "non-obedience" breed. It is not the titles and the scores but the journey that keeps me hooked. </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-justify"><span class="und-line">Training Philosophy</span>: I grew-up in the days of "pop and jerk" training methods. Fortunately, those days are long gone as we have learned "you get more with honey". Today I use positive methods with "clicker" training as my base. I love the relationship that is created and the learning that is possible when training is based on positive reinforcements. I believe you can "click" your way to an awesome dog. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify"><span class="und-line">Biography</span>: I have loved and trained dogs since I was a child, found a book “Dog Training for Kids” at age 8 or 9.  About the same time, I saw a demonstration of Utility obedience at the county fair, and I was hooked on developing a relationship with amazing canines!  I am a Registered Nurse, now retired, and raise sheep, ducks and Border Collies on my farm.  I was one of the 4-H Dog Club leaders in Vanderburgh County for 11 years when my adopted son, Tony was involved.  I continue to work with 4-H in several counties, and judge their dog shows.  I am a licensed herding judge for AKC and AHBA.  I have been a member of EOC for decades (interspersed with moving to California several times…)  I am also a member of the Agility Club of Evansville, and teach classes for both clubs.</p>
					
					<p><span class="und-line">Training Philosophy</span>: I primarily train using positive, reward-based techniques, but recognize that there is value in certain situations for use of any of the 4 quadrants of learning theory, so that defines me as a “balanced” trainer.  I am very much into teaching students to learn to “speak dog,” understand what the dog is telling them, and develop a training partnership with their dogs.</p>

					<p class="text-justify"><span class="und-line">Biography</span>: I have loved dogs all my life and have been obedience training my own dogs since 2006 when my husband and I brought home our first standard poodle puppy.   We have since added and trained four more wonderful standard poodles over the years and are constantly amazed at the intelligence and eagerness of a dog to learn.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Obedience training helps provide a foundation in good pet manners, and it teaches the human so much more about communicating and building a good relationship with your dog.  Training introduced my husband Jim and I to a great community of other dog lovers, and gave us the opportunity to spend time having fun with our dogs.  We continue with obedience classes and have gone on to compete in Obedience, Rally Obedience and Agility.</p>
