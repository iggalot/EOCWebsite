					<p class="wid-70 center-block top-pad-1m btm-mar-1m">Micah was an awesome find for me, who had previously had no completely European bred Doberman. He lived up to his impeccable pedigree, earning his CD at 2 years old. His conformation and movement were quite good. His temperament was fine and he did well in public. He also produced beautiful pups with good working drives. He was healthy all his life, until at about 10 years old he developed some knee problems. When he was almost 11 he developed cancer in the connective tissue of his knee. He passed in August 2009, after his 11th birthday.</p>

					<p class="wid-70 top-pad-1-halfm  bot-pad-1rm center-block">Amico was from Glory's only litter. The sire was Robusto van't Ravenland, another import from famous working and conformation lines. Amico was a good sized male with lots of bone. His temperament was exceptional. I chose not to breed him because his dam, Glory died of liver disease. Amico had a good life that was cut a bit short by the all too common Doberman afflication, dilated cardiomyopathy. Fortunate for me that, as of 2017, he is the only one I've kept who developed DCM.

					<p class="wid-70 center-block top-pad-1m btm-mar-1m">Amico's sister, I had high hopes of breeding her, until her mother died at age 6 years old. Like Amico, she was beautiful but she was far more high key. I couldn't keep her busy enough. Many of my dogs could have gone farther in obedience competition if I had had more time. Asti was also full of fun and affection. I never thought I'd have more than twice the time with her that I had with her dam. She was active well into her 14th year. She went down quickly in summer of 2014 at 14.5 years old.</p>

					<p class="wid-70 center-block btm-mar-1m">Each dog is special and precious. Yet, because of circumstances and of personality, some are just very Special. With Angel it was both. 8 pups delivered by C section and they all had to be bottled fed. Only 2 females &#40;6 males&#41; but I knew almost immediately which one was mine. Funny, with both Angel, and later with Chelsea, my Mom wanted me to pick a different one. But I knew the one for me.</p>
					<img src="../images/MemberPhotos/AngelProflie-Screen.jpg" width="800" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block bot-pad-1rm" alt="My Awesome Angel"/> 
					<p class="wid-70 center-block top-pad-1m bot-pad-1rm">Angel had that special something in the way she moved, and her observation of the situation showed her intelligence. She also had the better head. Unfortunately for us, I was advised to keep the pups sequestered well past week 8 because of fear of Parvo. They didn't get their mother's milk with the antibodies. They all did well healthwise, but I waited too long to socialize Angel. I dreamed of showing her in obedience but she became fear aggressive in new locations. She was fine at home and could welcome new dogs there, but away from home was a scary place for her. Nonetheless, I treasured every moment I had with my Gorgeous Angel. Devoted and yet somewhat reserved. She sensed what I wanted without me speaking, and she was the Best Companion, causing me so little trouble and bringing me so much joy.</p>

					<p class="wid-70 center-block"><img src="../images/MemberPhotos/angel%202.jpg" width="183" class="img-responsive img-rounded lt-float lf-pic-pad" alt="My sweet Angel was always alike a Princess"/>I bred Angel twice and she delivered one puppy on 12-30-2008. Ethan was a "fading puppy" and despite multiple, intense attempts to save him we lost him on 1-2-2009. I was crushed and Angel was looking for her puppy. It was a dark time, but the light in her soul carried us through for more than another 5 years. In October 2013 I found a mass and she had a mammary gland tumor removed. My vet thought she got all of it, but by January I knew something was wrong. Ever the true Doberman, tough and devoted, she fought to stay with me until I sent her home.</p>

					<p class="wid-70 center-block top-pad-1m bot-pad-1rm">Rufina was given to a friend of mine by Joyce Terrell of Magenta Farms. I heartily endorse Joyce's choices in importing and breeding European Dobermans. I owe her a great deal for the joy that she brought into my life, via our Dobermans. My friend had one litter with Rufina. I knew that Micah and Rufina would produce some great pups. I bought Rufina in early 2003 and that December I got one of my greatest birthday and Christmas presents ever.</p>

					<p class="wid-70 center-block top-pad-1m bot-pad-1rm">The C litter was one of the best working Dobermans we produced. Their protective instincts were second to none! It was my one stumbling blocks with Chelsea. She always tried to keep the other dogs at trials away from me. When I think of a tough Doberman I think of Rufina. She went through a lot over the years and she remained always on top and full of determination and protection. Here's one of my favorite photos, Mother and Daughter, Chelsea.</p>

They were both rewarding and heartbreaking. Glory passed in the fall of 2003, the B litter pups were in new homes but I was still concerned about Angel's development. Angel turned 1 year old about a month after Glory passed and 2 weeks later Rufina delivered the C litter. Then in early spring 2004 Nicki passed. I lost my first dam and her first puppy within 5 months of each other. The C litter was my 5th and was one of the best when it came to conformation and working apptitude. Chelsea exemplifies the best of that litter.</p>

She's always been there to comfort me. Chelsea's always been physically and mentally strong. She demonstrates the Doberman temperament with her devotion, intelligence, nobility and protective instincts. She fears nothing. I wonder if I'll ever be so blessed again as I was when I received Angel and Chelsea. I wish I had more photos from earlier days but since my cameras went ditial in 2006 I have many memories to share. Here are just a few</p>

My favorites were Fritz, who got his Schutzhund 1, and Danni, who produced several litters. Zoe is from Danni by <span class="red">CKC CH/Intl. CH/BIS UKC CH</span> Bell'Lavoros Dio Di Giove, <span class="red">CGC, TDI, WAC, VCX, DV-ZTP1A, ADPr, FH, IPO3, VPG3, SCH3, WD3, Korung 1B</span>, one of few American bred Dobermans to pass the German Körung breed survey. Zoe is very devoted and can perform quite well in the ring. However, she seems to have some ADD along with the OCD that most Dobes have, resulting in us always coming up one exercise short of our 3rd leg in Graduate Novice. But I gotta love her. She is always glued to me.</p>

						<p class="wid-70 center-block top-pad-1m">Lisey has the terrific working drive of her dam and the spirit of her sire who was sharp. Unlike Zoe her focus in work and play is terrific and she loves working with me, whereas Zoe would just as soon be chllin'. Lisey could go far, and I do plan to get her BH and hopefully WAC. But her enthusiasm for other dogs, and sometimes dominating them, has led into an unpleasant event in the ring. She didn't like the male Dobe next to her invading her space and she reacted sharply, though not touching him. I wish she could be more pacific, but I was extremely proud that she didn't touch the other dog and she held her sit stay. I certainly don't want to disrupt the class for the other teams, but I do wish they could know that Lisey is not vicious. Here she is with her close friend Sophia, a Chinese Crested. They've slept together for years.</p>

				<h2>Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</h2>
				<p class="wid-70 center-block btm-mar-1m">Dobermans have brought much joy to my life. Other dogs have done so as well but Dobermans will forever be special for me. Despite all the unpleasant times I wouldn't change it if I could. I had six litters, three of which were equal to any of the best of today's "Total Doberman". I tried breeding Zoe twice and Lisey once. After 3 failures I decided it wasn't meant to be.</p>
				<p class="wid-70 center-block top-mar-1-twom btm-mar-1m">I still have hope for tomorrow since I have Micah's semen in storage. I hope to see yet more Micah puppies before I cross the Rainbow Bridge to join my family. Last year I took over the job of editor of "Focus", the United Doberman Club quarterly magazine. I put together a photo collage for my column. Here's my pack since May 2014 when Asti passed a month after Angel. From left to right: Chelsea, Lisey, Zoe</p>
