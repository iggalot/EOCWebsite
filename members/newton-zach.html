					NEWBURGH &#8212;
					Zach Newton, 29, of Newburgh, never intended to become a full-time
					professional dog handler. But Newton's showing last week at the 2010
					Westminster Kennel Club dog show in New York City might change all that.</p>
					<p>Newton, a concrete and masonry worker, handled a
					2-year-old papillon &#8212; whose name is Ch. Majestic Joy Madame Butterfly
					(Katrina for short) &#8212; at Westminster. From a class entry of 27 dogs,
					Katrina not only made the final cut, but wound up ranked third among
					females.</p>
					<p>Neither Newton nor Katrina had shown at Westminster
					before. In fact, the two have been a team for only little more than a
					half-year.</p>
					<p>Newton had been handling Leroy, the 17th-ranked papillon
					in the country, for Robert and Gloria Meriwether of Paducah, Ky. In May
					2009, he took on the Meriwethers' young female, Katrina. </p>
					<p>"I finished her championship in seven shows," Newton
					said. "I've never done that with a dog before. I've had some finish in
					six to eight months, but never seven shows."</p>
					<p>In the few months before Westminster, Newton and Katrina
					racked up multiple Best of Breed and Group wins. (Group is the
					competition among all breed winners within a variety of dogs.)</p>
					<p>The road to Westminster, the most prestigious dog show
					in the country, was not an easy one ... literally. What should have
					been a 12-hour trip from Indianapolis to New York City took nearly 16
					hours. </p>
					<p>"It was snowing so hard, we were going 30 mph, and
					people were pulling off the road all along the way," Newton said. "It
					was bad."</p>
					<p>Once in New York, Newton's wife, Stacy Harris,
					immediately proposed a shopping trip. Though shopping wasn't high on
					Newton's list, he acquiesced. </p>
					<p>"I didn't want to stay in the hotel room, so I put
					Katrina in her carry bag and joined my wife and her friend," he said.</p>
					<p>One of their first stops was Tiffany &amp; Co. One
					of their first purchases was a necklace for the dog.</p>
					<p>The final purchase was a light blue rubber necklace
					(made for people) with a sterling silver heart charm that was engraved
					with: "Please return to Tiffany &amp; Co. if found."</p>
					<p>As beautiful as the diamonds were at Tiffany's, it was
					Katrina who dazzled shoppers. </p>
					<p>"I had to keep unzipping the bag and getting her out so
					people could pet her," Newton said. "We had a lot of people telling us
					they'd be watching and cheering for us at Westminster."</p>
					<p>Newton and Katrina walked onto the famed green carpets
					of Westminster to a sold-out crowd. The floor was so crammed with
					spectators that Newton had to cradle Katrina as he shouldered his way
					through the throngs of people to the show ring. </p>
					<p>Spectators were pressed 10 people deep against the
					purple velvet ropes that encircled the ring, and all were armed with
					cameras, creating a near constant shower of bright flashes. This
					alarmed many of the papillons, as did the sound emanating from the
					hollow floor. </p>
					<p>"If you were heavy-footed, the floor made a loud clunk,
					clunk, clunk sound," Newton said. </p>
					<p>The fact that the examination table was draped in velvet
					was enough to completely dissolve the dogs with less stalwart
					temperaments. Katrina, however, was fine. </p>
					<p>Newton says he couldn't be happier with the way Katrina
					showed in the ring. </p>
					<p>"To make the cut (final eight) with all these dogs, that
					was good," he said. </p>
					<p>He conceded winning would have been nice. </p>
					<p>"I will be talking to the dog's owners next week as to
					how they want to campaign Katrina (in 2010)," Newton said. "They are
					talking about hitting the big shows all over the United States this
					year. This may become my full-time job." </p>
